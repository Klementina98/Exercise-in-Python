("""What Are We Searching for on Mars?
Martians terrified me growing up. I remember watching the 1996 movie Mars Attacks! and fearing that the Red Planet harbored hostile alien neighbors. Though I was only 6 at the time, I was convinced life on Mars meant little green men wielding vaporizer guns. There was a time, not so long ago, when such an assumption about Mars wouldn’t have seemed so far-fetched.
Like a child watching a scary movie, people freaked out after listening to “The War of the Worlds,” the now-infamous 1938 radio drama that many listeners believed was a real report about an invading Martian army. Before humans left Earth, humanity’s sense of what—or who—might be in our galactic neighborhood was, by today’s standards, remarkably optimistic.

("""Mountains of Ice are Melting, But Don't Panic (Op-Ed)
If the planet lost the entire West Antarctic ice sheet, global sea level would rise 11 feet, threatening nearly 13 million people worldwide and affecting more than $2 trillion worth of property. 
Ice loss from West Antarctica has been increasing nearly three times faster in the past decade than during the previous one — and much more quickly than scientists predicted.
This unprecedented ice loss is occurring because warm ocean water is rising from below and melting the base of the glaciers, dumping huge volumes of additional water — the equivalent of a Mt. Everest every two years — into the ocean.

Finding extraterrestrial life is the essence of science fiction. But it's not so far-fetched to predict that we might find evidence of life on a distant planet within a generation.

"For the first time in human history, we might have the capability to do this."

Hallucinogenic mushrooms are perhaps the last thing you'd expect to find growing in the Queen of England's garden.
Yet a type of mushroom called Amanita muscaria — commonly known as fly agaric, or fly amanita — was found growing in the gardens of Buckingham Palace by the producers of a television show, the Associated Press reported on Friday (Dec. 12).
A. muscaria is a bright red-and-white mushroom, and the fungus is psychoactive when consumed.

At the corner of Brandon Mill Road, where Johnson Ferry Road turns into Dalrymple Road, tucked among 24 forested acres, sits an early 20th Century farmhouse. A vestige of Sandy Springs' past, the old home has found new life as the centerpiece of Lost Forest Preserve. While the preserve isn't slated to officially debut until some time next year, the city has opened the hiking trails to the public until construction begins on the permanent parking lot (at the moment the parking lot is a mulched area). The new park space includes community garden plots, a 4,000-foot-long hiking trail and an ADA-accessible trail through the densely wooded site. For Atlantans seeking an alternate escape to serenity (or those who dig local history), it's certainly worth a visit.

The meteor shower is called the "Geminids" because they appear as though they are shooting out of the constellation of Gemini. The meteors are thought to be small pieces of an extinct comment called 3200 Phaeton, a dust cloud revolving around the sun. Phaeton is thought to have lost all of its gas and to be slowly breaking apart into small particles.
Earth runs into a stream of debris from 3200 Phaethon every year in mid-December, causing a shower of meteors, which hit its peak over the weekend.
